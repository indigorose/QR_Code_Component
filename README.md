## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

This is my first HTML/CSS page in a while so it was interesting to see what I could remember. I've used the BEM naming convention with my class names. I note that some people use a single hyphen or double hyphen after naming the block.

Also in my first attempt, I missed out some box shadowing which I haven't seen in a while on web applications.

I think this will be attempted again using a CSS framework when I have time.
